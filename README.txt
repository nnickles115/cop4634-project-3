The extra credit portion of this assignment has been completed.

To build the Unidirectional version of this project run this:
make uni

This will generate a "lizardsUni" binary.

Running just "make" or "make all" will only build the Bidrectional
version of the project.

Running "make clean" will clean all files from both versions.
